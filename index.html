    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Bareera Bilal, currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Application along with a Diploma in
      Software
      Engineering from Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir. With a strong academic foundation and a passion for technology, I
      thrive on turning ideas into impactful digital solutions.

      I have hands-on experience in C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and ASP.NET Core, React, Redux, WebApi which allows
      me to develop responsive, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. My focus lies in combining clean,
      efficient logic with
      modern, sleek design to deliver meaningful user experiences.

      Beyond technical skills, I am continuously expanding my expertise in full-stack development, problem-solving, and
      software architecture. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my creativity and push me to explore new
      technologies.

      When I am not coding, I love exploring new tools, reading about emerging trends in tech, and contributing to
      innovative projects that enhance both my skills and the community around me.

      My goal is to become a skilled software developer who not only builds applications but also crafts solutions that
      make a real difference.
