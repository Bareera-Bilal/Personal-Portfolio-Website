Final Steps to Push Your Code
1. Stage All Your Files
This tells Git which files to include in the commit:

bash
git add .
2. Commit Your Changes
This saves a snapshot of your project:

bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Personal Portfolio Website"
3. Push to GitHub
Now send your code to the GitHub repository:

bash
git push -u origin main
ðŸ’¡ If your GitHub repo uses master instead of main, use:

bash
git push -u origin master
