Final Steps to Push Your Code
1. Stage All Your Files
This tells Git which files to include in the commit:

bash
git add .
2. Commit Your Changes
This saves a snapshot of your project:

bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Personal Portfolio Website"
3. Push to GitHub
Now send your code to the GitHub repository:

bash
git push -u origin main
ðŸ’¡ If your GitHub repo uses master instead of main, use:

bash
git push -u origin mastergit push -u origin master





echo "# Calculator" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Bareera-Bilal/Calculator.git
git push -u origin main

â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/Bareera-Bilal/Calculator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
