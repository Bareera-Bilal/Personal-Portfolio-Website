# Personal-Portfolio-Website
A responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. This project showcases my front-end development skills through a minimalist layout, glowing visual accents, and structured sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. Designed to reflect a modern aesthetic and highlight technical proficiency in web design.
